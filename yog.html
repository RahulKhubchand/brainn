<p><b><h1><u>Paschimottanasana Steps</u></h1></center>
1.Bring your arms straight out to the sides and up over your head, reaching toward the ceiling.<br>
2.Inhale and draw your spine up long.<br>
3.As you exhale, begin to come forward, hinging at your hips. Imagine your pelvis as a bowl of water that is tipping forward.<br>
4.On each inhale, lengthen your spine. You may come a bit out of your forward bend to do this.<br>
5.On each exhale, deepen into your forward bend. Imagine your belly coming to rest on your thighs, rather than your nose coming to your knees. This will help you keep your spine long.<br>
6.Keep the neck as the natural extension of your spine, neither cranking it to look up nor letting it go completely.<br>
7.When you have come to your full extension with the spine long, decide whether you want to stay here or let your spine round forward.<br>
8.Take hold of your ankles or shins, whichever you can reach. You can also use a strap around your feet. Keep your feet flexed strongly throughout.<br></b>

<h2><u>To Keep in Mind:</u></h2>
<h3>It is essential that during practice, the older people should not push themselves and do only as much as their body permits.
Even a long duration of a yoga session is not suitable for them. Short and simple is ideal.</h3>
